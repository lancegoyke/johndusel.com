I'll analyze your codebase to provide an estimate of the effort required to restore the site after taking it down. Let me start by examining the overall structure and technology stack.

Based on my analysis of your codebase, I can provide you with a comprehensive estimate for restoring the `johndusel.com` site after taking it down. Here's my assessment:

## **Estimated Restoration Time: 16-24 hours**

### **Infrastructure Setup (8-12 hours)**

**AWS Infrastructure (3-4 hours):**

- Launch new AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance
- Configure security groups and networking
- Set up AWS S3 bucket for media storage
- Configure AWS IAM roles and policies for deployment
- Set up AWS credentials and access keys

**Server Configuration (4-6 hours):**

- Install and configure Nginx reverse proxy
- Set up Python environment and virtual environment
- Install Node.js and npm
- Create systemd service files for:
  - `gunicorn-johndusel.com.service`
  - `nextjs-johndusel.com.service`
- Configure log directories and permissions
- Set up SSL certificates (Let's Encrypt)

**Database & Backup Setup (1-2 hours):**

- Restore SQLite database from S3 backups
- Configure cron jobs for automated database backups
- Set up backup synchronization with S3

### **Application Deployment (4-6 hours)**

**Backend Setup (2-3 hours):**

- Clone repository and set up deployment directory structure
- Configure production environment variables (`.production.env`)
- Install Python dependencies via `requirements.txt`
- Run database migrations
- Configure static file serving with Whitenoise
- Set up Django admin superuser

**Frontend Setup (2-3 hours):**

- Install Node.js dependencies
- Build Next.js application
- Configure production environment variables
- Set up static file serving

### **CI/CD & External Services (2-3 hours)**

**GitHub Actions (1-2 hours):**

- Configure GitHub repository secrets:
  - `EC2_HOST`, `EC2_USERNAME`, `EC2_PORT`
  - `EC2_PRIVATE_KEY`, `GH_DEPLOY_PRIVATE_KEY`
  - AWS credentials for deployment
- Test automated deployment pipeline

**External Services (1 hour):**

- Verify Sentry error tracking configuration
- Confirm MailerLite integration for newsletter
- Test TinyMCE editor functionality

### **Testing & DNS Configuration (2-3 hours)**

**System Testing (1-2 hours):**

- Verify all endpoints are working
- Test content management system
- Confirm media file uploads to S3
- Validate RSS feed generation
- Test email newsletter signup

**DNS & Final Setup (1 hour):**

- Configure domain DNS records
- Verify SSL certificate installation
- Final production testing

## **Key Factors That Could Affect Timeline:**

### **Complexity Factors (Low Risk):**

- **Well-documented codebase** with clear setup instructions
- **Automated deployment** via GitHub Actions
- **Modern, stable tech stack** (Django 5.1, Next.js 14)
- **SQLite database** (simple to restore)
- **Comprehensive backup system** already in place

### **Potential Challenges (Medium Risk):**

- **AWS credential configuration** and IAM role setup
- **Systemd service configuration** for both applications
- **Nginx configuration** for reverse proxy
- **SSL certificate renewal** setup
- **Environment variable configuration** across multiple services

### **Dependencies That Must Be Restored:**

- **AWS S3 bucket** with existing media files
- **Sentry project** configuration
- **Domain name** and DNS management
- **GitHub repository** access and secrets
- **MailerLite account** for newsletter functionality

## **Recommended Approach:**

1. **Start with infrastructure** (AWS EC2, security groups, S3)
2. **Set up server environment** (Nginx, Python, Node.js)
3. **Deploy applications** (Django backend, Next.js frontend)
4. **Configure services** (systemd, cron jobs, backups)
5. **Test thoroughly** before pointing DNS

## **Cost Considerations:**

- AWS EC2 instance costs will resume
- AWS S3 storage costs (minimal)
- Domain registration/renewal costs
- Sentry monitoring costs (if applicable)

The site appears to be well-architected with good documentation and automated deployment, which significantly reduces restoration complexity. The 16-24 hour estimate assumes you have access to all necessary credentials and the original AWS infrastructure can be recreated.

Would you like me to break down any specific part of this estimate in more detail?
